# TutorMe

TutorMe is an application created in collaboration with 4 other developers as part of the Advanced Software Development course (CS 3240) at UVA. It is built using Python and the Django framework. TutorMe was originally hosted on Heroku. This version is copied over from the private repository. 

The application:
- Supports Google Authentication login with two different user access levels (tutor/student). 
- Incorporates UVA's SIS API (https://api.devhub.virginia.edu/v1/courses) to populate the application with available UVA departments and courses 
- Allows tutors to view and select courses to be a tutor for, submit their availabilities, accept/decline tutoring requests from students, and post hourly rates.
- Allows students to view tutor profiles for each course, submit a request for a tutor at a particular time, and leave a review under a tutor profile.
